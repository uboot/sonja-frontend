  <h3>Conan Configuration</h3>

  <p>
    The build environment will be initialized with a Conan configuration from an 
    external git repository. Provide the <em>URL</em> of the git repository here.
    If the configuration is not located at the root of the repository but in 
    a subdirectory set <em>Path</em> to the location of the directory.
    If a branch other than the default branch should be used as a source of the configuration 
    this branch can optionally be specified in the field <em>Branch</em>. 
  </p>

  <h3>Conan Remote</h3>

  <p>This ecosystem will store Conan packages at to one of the Conan remotes which are 
    defined by the Conan configuration above. Usually additional credentials are required to be 
    able to <em>upload</em> packages to the remote.
    Here, this remote and the credentials to access it are defined. Set <em>Remote</em>
    to the name of the remote as defined by the Conan configuration. The actual URL
    of the remote is then looked up via the configuration during the build. 
    If required provide a user name and a password. Before uploading Conan
    will login into the remote using this credentials.
