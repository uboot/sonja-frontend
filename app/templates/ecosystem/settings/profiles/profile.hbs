  <h4>Labels</h4>

  <p>
    Labels are strings which can be assigned to profiles. Labels can be used to identify a
    set of profiles which share a common property. E.g. profiles which refer to debug 
    builds might carry the label <code>debug</code>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It is possible to exclude profiles with certain labels fromr the build of a repository.
    E.g. a repository which defines <code>debug</code> as one of its <em>exclude labels</em>
    will not be built for profiles which share the <code>debug</code> label.
